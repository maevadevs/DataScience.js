## Synopsis <a name="synopsis"></a>
On one hand, *Data is the new oil*. It is ubiquitous and found everywhere. We are creating, sharing, updating, and deleting billions of data per day. In fact, Data Science is a large field that is constantly expanding. The current tools and framework mainly used for this field are revolving around languages such as Python, Julia, R, SQL.

One the other hand, the web is also ubiquitous and JavaScript is fastly becoming the "King" language of it. At first only considered with a light footprint language to scripting for the *FrontEnd*, JavaScript is now expanding into many fields, from *BackEnd* to *Mobile*. The rapid developement of its standard (ES5, ES2015, ES2016, ES2017) and integration of multiple programming paradigms (Object-Oriented, Functional...) are making it into a serious behemoth of a language that cannot be taken lightly anymore.

So, in this repository, we make the assertion that we should bring Data Science to the Web and the Web to Data Science. For that purpose, we assert that JavaScript can be made into a language that could address this intention.

## Current Status: Existing Tools <a name="current_status"></a>
Here, we gather existing resources that address, explore, and expand on the current state of using JavaScript as a language and framework for addressing problems related to Data Science. It is our hope that this step would expand the door to bring Data Science and Web together.

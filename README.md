## Synopsis
On one hand, *Data is the new oil*. It is ubiquitous and found everywhere. We create, share, update, and delete billions of data per day. In fact, Data Science is a large field that is constantly expanding. The current tools and framework mainly used for this field are revolving around languages such as Python, Julia, R, SQL.

One the other hand, the web is also ubiquitous and JavaScript is fastly becoming the "King" language of it. At first only considered with a light footprint language for scripting the *FrontEnd*, JavaScript is now expanding into many fields, from *BackEnd* to *FrontEnd* to *Mobile* to *Analytics* and more. The rapid developement of its standard (ES5, ES2015, ES2016, ES2017) and integration of multiple programming paradigms (Object-Oriented, Functional...) are making it into a serious behemoth of a language that cannot be taken lightly anymore.

So, in this repository, I make the assertion that we should more on bringing Data Science to the Web and the Web to Data Science. For that purpose, I assert that JavaScript can be made into a language that could address this intention and explore that possibility though research and resource gathering. 

**Note:** Eventually, I might start to write some sort of library or framework that would somehow combine what I find in my research, which--I disclaim--might end up being opinionated.

## Current Status: Existing Tools
This is an ongoing effort.

In this section, I gather existing resources that I find and that address, explore, and expand on the current state of using JavaScript as a language and framework for addressing problems related to Data Science. (Only including maintained libraries/framework.) I hope that this step would expand the door to bring Data Science and Web more closer together.

**Note:** Because this is for benefiting the community, I only list resources that are open-source or has a *community* version offer. Also, I try to be less opinionated so resources that are limited to only a single framework (e.g. *n3-charts* for *Angular*) are excluded.
